<h3><a name="whatsnew"></a>What's new in version 2.01.02</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>DataWedge provides a convenient mechanism for non-scanning aware applications 
to receive data from embedded or connected data capture devices. 
DataWedge v2.01.02 builds on v2.00.00 to include the following new features...</p>
<ul>
<li>New Test Display Window with interchangeable Text/Hex formats and extra information
<li>New Log Display Window with scrolling
<li>Improved DataWedge Startup Time when MSR and RFID are present
<li>Gen2 RFID Support is added.
<li>Several other bug fixes:
<ul>
<li>Device Enable/Disable persistance over cold boot 
<li>Virtual Key Support and few other issues in Prefix/Suffix
<li>Smaller Controls for Feedback Parameters in order to accommodate broader edit boxes. 
<li>Enhancements in MSR reading
<li>Enable Serial Interface on startup
<li>Event Based Serial Reading Capability added removing earlier polling based mechanism.
<li>Delays regarding RFID are fixed
<li>Double quote character in barcodes was scanned as Single quote
<li>Tilda (~) character in barcodes caused abnormal behavior over Remote Desktop Client
<li>Fixed Data Corruption issue in Binary mode ("Don't treat Data as Text"), where when you exit out of DW in Binary mode and run it later scanned barcodes got corrupted. 
<li>CAPSLOCK state caused barcode alpha characters to change case (See Known Issues for some inconsistency in Windows Mobile)
<li>Group Seperator character (0x1D) could not be sent to Remote Desktop. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="install"></a>Installation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To install DataWedge so that it is launched automatically after a cold boot (clean boot for WM2005) , do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip the DataWedge download package into a temporary folder on your PC
<li>If installing on a <b>Pocket PC</b> device, copy "\Bin\PPC\DataWedge.exe" from your PC to the \Application folder on the device
<li>If installing on a <b>Windows CE</b> device, copy "\Bin\WCE\DataWedge.exe" from your PC to the \Application folder on the device
<li>Copy "\Application\DataWedge.cpy" from your PC to the \Application folder on the device
<li>Copy "\Application\Startup\DataWedge.run" from your PC to the \Application\Startup folder on the device
<li>Cold boot (clean boot for WM2005) the device
</ol>

<h3><a name="usage"></a>Usage Notes</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><b>MSR API</b> - In order to support the MSR, DataWedge requires the new MSR API (MSRAPI32.DLL)
<li><b>MC 1000</b> - The user does not have access to the UI when using DataWedge on the MC 1000
<li><b>RFID</b> - Support for RFID should be considered as beta; see known issues below
<li><b>MK 2000</b> - Support for the MK 2000 in this version is in beta although there are no known issues
</ol>

<h3><a name="device"></a>Device Updates</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Before using DataWedge with your mobile computer you may need to update certain drivers. 
Refer to the DriverUpdateInfo.txt file located in "\Program Files\Symbol Mobility Developer Kit for eVC4\v1.4\DriverUpdates" 
for more information about the individual files that can be updated and what devices are supported.</p>
<p><b>MSRAPI32 Support</b></p>
<p>In the event that a device in the field has not been updated to the latest MSR software, 
you can update your device by copying the following files to the \Platform directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>MsrApi32.dll
<li>MagStripe.cpy
<li>MagStripe.reg
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> A cold boot (clean boot for WM2005) must be performed after any update to ensure the files have been installed properly.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> In Windows Mobile 2005, the \Platform does not exist. Hence the above files should be copied to \Application folder and .cpy file should be edited appropriately.</p>

<h3><a name="knownissues"></a>Known issues</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>RFID support can be affected by hardware and firmware versions
<li>On RFID devices with Platform version Plat0301074 DataWedge may not exit correctly; requiring a warm boot
<li>On RFID devices with internal WJ module DataWedge may intermittently fail to detect/open the RFID module
<li>The beep time in the feedback settings may not change the length of the beep on PDT8100 WM2003 devices
<li>The barcode feedback menu may be missing the beep time and frequency fields on MC50 WM2003 devices
<li>MSR Feedback Settings can’t be changed effectively. Watever the value we keep, the same parameter the hardware would work at. 
<li>Barcode Feedback Setting "LED Time" can’t be changed effectively.
<li>The '\f' and '\n' prefix/suffix characters may be ignored on CE4.2 devices
<li>In Auto-PIE mode, after PIE has popped up and KeyBoard is on, if you kill PIE KeyBoard area becomes inactive. User should Hide the KeyBoard via "Hide Input Panel".
<li>MC 3000 Dialog windows may appear imbalanced and too much oriented to the left side of the screen.
<li>In WM when you connect to the TSC and then Enable CAPSLOCK, then type few characters while CAPS lock is on, then Close TSC with the X on right hand corner and Then again invoke TSC and scan a barcode, this will result in case Inversion.
<li>If you check the option &quot;<span class="black">Send keys only to Pocket IE&quot; at 
least for one scanner type, data from all four scanner types are diverted to 
Pocket IE.</span><li><span class="black">If you select Serial Option &quot;Send data 
after X seconds&quot; and set its timer to more than 2 seconds the data would not 
be sent.</span></ol>
